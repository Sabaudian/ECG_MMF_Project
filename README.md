# ECG_MMF_Project
ECG signal conditioning by morphological Filtering

**MATLAB_R2021B Requirements**: 
Communications Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox  

I have attached the file '100m.mat' containing the ECG signal recovered from the physionet database (LINK: https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/).

The functions ECGwaveGen.m and QRSpulse.m are used to generate a simulated ECG signal with known characteristics. This two function are recovered from physionet.org (LINK: https://physionet.org).

The two pdf file are the documentations used to elaborate the project.
